** About Mia Core: **
Mia Core is a standards-based metadata model created by the Minneapolis Institute of Art for use across digital asset management systems. The Mia Core specification is simple, scalable, flexible. With a robust foundation of “required” fields based on Dublin Core, additional properties may be adopted or removed as desired. Mia Core is therefore a living specification which allows for iterative improvement as requirements evolve. New versions will be shared publicly via Mia’s [GitHub site](https://github.com/artsmia).

This metadata specification was developed with generous support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as part of Mia’s IMLS-funded “Enterprise Content Management Project”.
